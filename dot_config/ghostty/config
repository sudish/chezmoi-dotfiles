# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of

# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
